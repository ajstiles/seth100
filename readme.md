# Readme

Inspired by David Perell's 'Friday Finds' email from 5/22/20.

> Nobody writes short articles better than Seth Godin. If you're looking for something to read this weekend, start with his top 100 articles. They're a masterclass in clear writing.

 This script downloads [Seth Godin's top 100 articles](https://seths.blog/top-100/) and creates a single HTML file for easy reading.
